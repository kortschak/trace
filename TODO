This list contains some ideas for possible future improvements
of the trace package:

- The locking slows down calls to T() by a factor of more than 10 (in
  the absence of listeners).  Can anything be done to make this
  faster?  Maybe atomic.StorePointer can be used to implement
  something RCU like?

  (RCU was suggested on golang-nuts by Tamás Gulácsi)

- Kamil Kisiel suggested the following on golang-nuts: ... using build
  tags to allow completely compiling out tracing? So unless a program
  is build with -tags trace all the trace functions are replaced with
  empty ones.
